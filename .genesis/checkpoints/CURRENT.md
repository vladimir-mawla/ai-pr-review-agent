## M2 Build Summary (L1 BUILD complete -- NOT YET L4 VERIFIED)

### Outcome Achieved
- FastAPI POST /webhook verifies GitHub's HMAC-SHA256 signature over the RAW
  request body using `hmac.compare_digest` (backend/webhook_receiver/validator.py)
- Missing signature -> 401; malformed header shape -> 400; wrong signature -> 401;
  tampered body with an otherwise well-formed signature -> 401
- X-GitHub-Delivery idempotency: JobQueue.enqueue() is a no-op on a repeated
  delivery_id (backend/job_queue/{interface,in_memory}.py) -- verified by an
  actual queue-size assertion in tests, not just a second 200 response
- Only pull_request events with action in {opened, synchronize, reopened} are
  parsed and enqueued; everything else is acknowledged (200) and ignored
- No real queue yet (that's M3): enqueue sits behind a JobQueue Protocol so
  M3 can swap in Redis/ARQ without touching the router or its tests

### Gate Results (this session, full output in the L1 BUILD transcript)
- `ruff check .`: All checks passed, exit 0
- `mypy --strict backend/`: Success: no issues found in 31 source files, exit 0
- `pytest -v`: 47 passed (24 from M1 + 23 new webhook tests), exit 0
- `lint-imports --config .importlinter`: 2 contracts kept, 0 broken, exit 0
- PLAN.md's M2 demo command run verbatim (uvicorn backgrounded, signed POST,
  pytest): combined exit 0. Note: the literal `sleep 1` in that command was
  observed to be marginal on a cold start once during this session (uvicorn
  took slightly longer than 1s to bind, causing a connection-refused retry);
  a rerun succeeded within ~0.3-0.5s startup. Not modified since PLAN.md's
  exact command is what must be preserved, but the L4 verifier should be
  aware this specific demo command has a small flake risk on a slow machine.
- Verified no stray process left listening on :8000 after the demo run.

### Files Written
- `backend/core/settings.py`: pydantic-settings Settings (GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET, no default)
- `backend/webhook_receiver/validator.py`: HMAC verification (3 distinct exception types)
- `backend/webhook_receiver/parser.py`: raw payload -> WebhookEvent, SUPPORTED_ACTIONS
- `backend/job_queue/{interface,in_memory}.py`: JobQueue Protocol + InMemoryJobQueue
- `backend/webhook_receiver/router.py`: POST /webhook, dependency-injected via app.state
- `backend/api/main.py`: create_app() factory + module-level app for uvicorn
- `scripts/send_signed_webhook.py`: signs+POSTs the fixture payload as raw bytes
- `tests/unit/test_webhook_validator.py`: 23 tests (validator unit + route-level via TestClient)
- `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/fixtures/sample_pr_payload.json`, `.env.example`

### Architecture notes for the verifier
- `backend/core/settings.py` was placed in `backend.core` rather than a new
  top-level `backend.config` package, since `config` is not one of the 19
  subpackages in ADR-002's frozen module map and `core` is explicitly the
  layer for base abstractions all others depend on. Confirm this reading is
  acceptable, or that a dedicated config package should be added to the map.
- A local `.env` (GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=test-secret, gitignored, not pushed)
  is required for `uvicorn backend.api.main:app` to start, matching
  PLAN.md's demo command which does not export the env var inline. This is
  intentional -- documented in .env.example -- not a hardcoded secret.
- `tests/conftest.py` sets a placeholder `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var
  purely so importing `backend.api.main` (which builds its module-level
  `app` eagerly by design) doesn't break test collection with no `.env`
  present. No test uses that placeholder's value.

### Deferred / not built at M2 (explicitly out of scope, do not treat as gaps)
- No real Redis/ARQ queue (M3)
- No LangGraph orchestrator, no real agents (M4+)
- No real GitHub App integration (M11) -- signatures are verified against a
  locally-chosen test secret, per PLAN.md's M2 credential note

### Next Phase (M2 -> L4 VERIFY)
A separate agent/model session should run L4 VERIFY against this build:
re-run all four gates plus the demo command independently, check the DoD
gates in DONE.html section 2 relevant to M2 (HMAC verified + idempotency
before any work is enqueued; mypy --strict clean and pytest green; no
context-graph invariant violated), and confirm the architecture-placement
note above (backend.core.settings) is acceptable before marking M2 DONE.

## M1 Build Summary (L4 VERIFY APPROVED)

### Outcome Achieved
✓ 19-subpackage package layout exists with ADR-002 inward-only rule enforced
✓ Finding/Review/WebhookEvent Pydantic v2 contracts defined and unit-tested
✓ 24 comprehensive tests pass (100% pass rate)
✓ Model contracts reject invalid states at construction time
✓ Confidence bounds [0.000, 1.000] with 3-decimal precision enforced

### Gate Results
- `pytest tests/unit/test_models.py -v`: 24 PASSED in 0.06s ✓
- `lint-imports --config .importlinter`: 2 contracts kept, 0 broken ✓
- Code inspection: backend.core and backend.models both verified independent of every sibling package

### Files Written (34 files)
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata, Python 3.12 toolchain, dev dependencies
- `backend/models/{enums,findings,review,webhook}.py`: Core contracts (4 files)
- `backend/{core,agents,api,cli,database,economics,evaluation,hitl,integrations,job_queue,memory,models,observability,orchestrator,prompts,reliability,security,tools,webhook_receiver}/__init__.py`: 19-subpackage skeleton
- `tests/{__init__,unit/__init__,integration/__init__,e2e/__init__,contract/__init__,eval/__init__}.py`: Test directory structure
- `tests/unit/test_models.py`: 24 comprehensive test cases
- `.importlinter`: ADR-002 contract configuration (single source of truth; `setup.cfg` and the dead `pyproject.toml` copy were deleted)

### Commits (11 logical)
1. `chore(build): add pyproject.toml with Python 3.11 toolchain`
2. `feat(models): add Severity, AgentType, ReviewStatus enums`
3. `feat(models): add Finding contract with bounded confidence`
4. `feat(models): add Review and WebhookEvent contracts`
5. `feat(arch): establish 22-module monolith with ADR-002 inward-only dependencies` (historical commit subject — actual layout is 19 subpackages, see below)
6. `test(models): comprehensive unit tests for domain contracts`
7. `chore(genesis): checkpoint M1 build complete`
8. `fix(build): repair import-linter config so lint-imports actually runs`
9. `fix(models): clear ruff and mypy --strict findings in domain contracts`
10. `chore(build): move project to python 3.12`
11. `chore(build): pin import-linter to the 1.8 line matching our contract syntax`

### Deferred from M1 (pending user decision)
The L4 verifier confirmed the demo command passes and APPROVEd M1, but flagged the
following model-validation gaps as deliberately deferred rather than blocking:
- `Finding.line_end >= line_start` is not enforced (no cross-field validator)
- `Review.overall_confidence` is not cross-checked against the mean of `findings[].confidence`
- `WebhookEvent.delivery_id` is validated only by length (36 chars), not real UUID format
- Models are not frozen and do not set `validate_assignment`, so instances are mutable post-construction
- `WebhookPullRequest` and `WebhookRepository` in `backend/models/webhook.py` are unused dead code (only `WebhookEvent` is referenced)

### Next Phase (M2)
M2 begins with webhook ingress: HMAC validation and idempotency checking.
Precondition: M1 contracts are stable (they are, 24 tests validate all invariants).
